# reddit dev environment installer
# --------------------------------
# This script installs a reddit stack suitable for development. DO NOT run this
# on a system that you use for other purposes as it might delete important
# files, truncate your databases, and otherwise do mean things to you.
#
# By default, this script will install the reddit code in the current user's
# home directory and all of its dependencies (including libraries and database
# servers) at the system level. The installed reddit will expect to be visited
# on the domain "reddit.local" unless specified otherwise.  Configuring name
# resolution for the domain is expected to be done outside the installed
# environment (e.g. in your host machine's /etc/hosts file) and is not
# something this script handles.
#
# Several configuration options (listed in the "Configuration" section below)
# are overridable with environment variables. e.g.
#
#    sudo REDDIT_DOMAIN=example.com ./install-reddit.sh
